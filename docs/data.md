## Semantic dedup (`soup data dedup --semantic`)

`soup data dedup` removes near-duplicates with MinHash by default — fast, no
torch, but **lexical**: it compares shared token shingles, so two rows that say
the same thing in different words look unrelated to it.

`--semantic` compares embedding cosine instead:

```bash
soup data dedup train.jsonl --semantic -o clean.jsonl
soup data dedup train.jsonl --semantic --threshold 0.85 --field text -o clean.jsonl
soup data dedup train.jsonl --semantic --embed-model sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2
```

Requires the `[train]` extra (it reuses `transformers`; there is no new
dependency) and downloads a small embedding model on first use. Plain MinHash
`dedup` stays on the light core.

**What it buys you.** Measured against MinHash on the same rows
(all-MiniLM-L6-v2):

| pair | cosine | MinHash | `--semantic` |
|---|---|---|---|
| exact duplicate | 1.000 | caught | caught |
| "sorts **a list** of integers" / "sorts **an array** of integers" | 0.908 | **missed** | caught |
| "which sorts a list of **ints**" (reworded) | 0.880 | **missed** | caught |
| "Add two numbers" / "Multiply two numbers" | 0.759 | kept | kept (correct) |

So `--semantic` catches **rewordings** MinHash's shingling scores as distinct.

### It is not a paraphrase detector — and why the default is 0.8

Heavier paraphrases are **not** reliably separable. Measured, paraphrase cosines
(0.49–0.76) *overlap* with genuinely-distinct rows (0.54–0.76):

- "reverse a string" / "invert the order of characters" — a **true paraphrase** — scores **0.491**
- "Add two numbers" / "Multiply two numbers" — **two rows you must keep** — scores **0.759**

A real paraphrase can score *lower* than two rows that must both survive, so **no
threshold cleanly separates them**. Lowering `--threshold` to chase paraphrase
recall deletes real training rows — silent data loss, which is worse than keeping
a duplicate. The 0.8 default is deliberately conservative. Raise or lower it only
against your own data, and check what got dropped.

`--threshold` means Jaccard for MinHash and cosine for `--semantic`. They are
different scales; a value tuned for one is not meaningful for the other.

## Dataset Sanitization & Repair (`soup data clean`)

`soup data clean` applies deterministic hygiene rules to repair corrupted, malformed, or noisy fine-tuning datasets without ever modifying the input file in place:

```bash
# Clean dataset with safe non-destructive defaults -> writes to <input>_cleaned.jsonl
soup data clean raw_data.jsonl

# Specify custom output path
soup data clean raw_data.jsonl -o clean_data.jsonl

# Preview modifications and statistics without writing any files
soup data clean raw_data.jsonl --dry-run

# Output machine-readable JSON for CI/CD pipelines
soup data clean raw_data.jsonl --json

# Enable optional heuristic repairs (AI disclaimers, code fences, tool-call JSON, echo pruning)
soup data clean raw_data.jsonl --strip-boilerplate --repair-code --repair-json --prune-echo
```

### Cleaning Rules & Defaults:
- **Default (Safe & Non-Destructive):**
  1. **Control Characters & Whitespace:** Strips C0 controls (`\x00-\x1f`), zero-width spaces (`\u200b-\u200d`, `\ufeff`), and normalizes CRLF/CR to Unix LF.
  2. **Empty & Degenerate Turns:** Drops rows where the assistant turn is empty or shorter than `--min-tokens`.
- **Opt-In Heuristic Repairs (Flags):**
  1. `--strip-boilerplate`: Strips canned preambles (*"Certainly! As an AI language model..."*) and sign-offs (*"I hope this helps!"*) across multiple passes.
  2. `--repair-code`: Auto-closes unclosed triple backtick (```` ``` ````) code fences in assistant completions.
  3. `--repair-json`: Unwraps markdown code blocks from JSON arguments and repairs trailing commas in tool calls.
  4. `--prune-echo`: Drops rows where the assistant merely repeats the user prompt verbatim.

Supports all standard formats: `chatml`, `alpaca`, `sharegpt`, `dpo`, `kto`, and `tool-calling`.

## Topic map (`soup data topics`)

See what you are actually training on:

```bash
soup data topics train.jsonl                       # 'auto' picks the cluster count
soup data topics train.jsonl --clusters 8 -o topics.json
```

Embeds every row, clusters with k-means, and labels each cluster with c-TF-IDF
terms — terms frequent in *that* cluster and rare elsewhere, so filler words like
"the" never become a label. Prints a coverage table plus a warning for any topic
under 2% of the data:

```
        Topic map — 4200 rows, 6 clusters
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Topic                    ┃ Rows ┃ Coverage ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━┩
│ function / python / code │ 3444 │    82.0% │
│ theorem / proof / math   │  252 │     6.0% │
│ refuse / harmful / safe  │   42 │     1.0% │
└──────────────────────────┴──────┴──────────┘
topic 'refuse / harmful / safe' is thin: 1.0% of rows (42/4200)
```

Labels are **emergent term clusters**, not a classification against a fixed
taxonomy: "82% code" means 82% of rows landed in a cluster whose top terms look
like code. Requires `[train]`.

## Canaries (`soup data canary insert|check`)

Prove whether a model memorized your data — for leak detection and provenance.

```bash
# 1. insert K unique secrets (keep the manifest OUT of your repo)
soup data canary insert train.jsonl -o canaried.jsonl --count 16 --manifest secrets.json

# 2. train on canaried.jsonl as usual, then:
soup data canary check --manifest secrets.json --base ./my-model --adapter ./lora
```

`check` measures the model's loss on each inserted secret and ranks it against
never-inserted **controls** drawn from the same secret space and sharing the same
carrier prompt — so a low loss means the *secret* is unusually likely, not the
prompt. Exit **2** on MAJOR, so CI can gate on a leak.

This is loss-vs-controls (Carlini et al., *The Secret Sharer*), not "ask the model
and see if it says the secret": a model can memorize a canary and still not emit
it under greedy decoding, so "nothing came back" would be false reassurance.

The verdict asks whether **more** canaries look memorized than chance explains
(binomial tail, α=0.05) rather than whether any single one dipped low — with 16
canaries, an "any single one" rule fires on a **clean** model about 15% of the
time, which would make a CI gate useless.

Measured on SmolLM2-135M:

| model | loss | percentiles | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| trained on the canaries | 1.7–2.5 | all 0.0% | **MAJOR** (exit 2) |
| never saw them | 4.1–6.2 | 1.6%–93% | OK (exit 0) |

**The manifest is the sensitive artifact**, not the dataset: anyone holding it can
reproduce the secrets. It is written `0600` on POSIX and must not be committed
alongside the data it protects. `check --output` embeds the same secrets.

Exposure is a **sampled-control approximation**, not full-space rank enumeration —
"no exposure" is not proof of no memorization.

## Data Engineering Pro

The v0.69.0 release ships 5 surfaces that turn dataset prep from "throw a JSONL at the trainer" into a first-class engineering workflow.

```

Every command applies the project-wide TOCTOU policy (`os.lstat + S_ISLNK` symlink rejection before any open) and cwd containment via the shared `paths.enforce_under_cwd_and_no_symlink` helper. All five are LIVE: `soup build` materialises with five built-in transforms (`identity` / `drop_empty` / `lowercase` / `strip` / `dedup_exact`) and SQLite-tracked incremental re-transform (v0.71.6); `soup data gen-magpie` and provider-backed `best-of-n` harvest via raw completion against `--provider ollama|vllm` (SSRF-validated; `anthropic` rejected because the Messages API has no raw-completion endpoint). Provider-backed `best-of-n` records the sampler provider and model in each row's `_best_of_n` provenance; omit `--provider` to retain the local Transformers `--base` path.

`best-of-n` fsyncs each completed prompt group to a private recovery journal
(`<output>.checkpoint.jsonl` by default). `--resume` reuses only a sequential
prefix whose prompt and run-configuration digest matches exactly, so completed
prompts are not sampled or judged twice. Before final publication, Soup snapshots
any prior SFT, DPO, and manifest targets. Each file remains an atomic replacement,
the manifest is written last, and any failed replacement restores the complete old
generation or removes the newly created set. The manifest binds the exact SHA-256
hashes and row counts as one generation. Keep or archive the checkpoint after
success if reproducible rematerialization is useful; it contains dataset content
and should be protected like the generated dataset.

The candidate artifact preserves every ordered candidate with prompt, candidate,
group, and whole-artifact SHA-256 bindings plus a public sampler specification.
The offline phase validates complete one-to-one coverage before writing anything:
missing or duplicate prompt ids, changed group digests, invalid winner indexes,
score-count drift, non-finite scores, and winner/score disagreement all fail
closed. It does not construct a sampler or judge. SFT and DPO rows retain the
candidate-artifact and judgment-file digests, group id, public sampler settings,
and bounded verifier identity. Endpoint URLs and local model paths are never
copied into those artifacts. Reusing the same two input files produces identical
training-row bytes. The offline command writes `<output>.manifest.json` last (or
the explicit `--manifest` path) and binds the exact SFT/DPO hashes, row counts,
candidate artifact, judgment file, and whether DPO output was requested. Treat
the manifest as the commit marker: missing or mismatched manifests identify an
interrupted or replaced generation.

The candidate artifact and verified judgment file are the durable recovery
boundary for offline materialization. This phase performs no sampling, so it has
no progress checkpoint: `--resume` and `--checkpoint` are rejected. After any
late write failure, keep those two inputs and rerun the exact offline command.
Soup removes the previous manifest before replacing outputs and publishes the
new manifest last. A prior, manifest-authenticated DPO beside the manifest is
removed when the replacement run requests SFT only.

Consumers must verify the final manifest and open exactly the SFT/DPO files it
lists. They must never discover training inputs by globbing neighboring JSONL
files: an unlisted sidecar, including an older DPO stored elsewhere, is not part
of the committed generation.

Candidate export durably checkpoints each completed prompt group at
`<artifact>.checkpoint.jsonl`. If sampling stops, rerun the same command with
`--resume`; Soup authenticates the checkpoint against the prompts and sampler
before continuing at the first incomplete group. Candidate and judgment inputs
are validated through a temporary disk index, and final SFT/DPO files are staged
incrementally, so memory does not grow with the complete artifact size.
For a local model directory, the checkpoint binds the exact regular-file names,
sizes, and contents through a privacy-safe fingerprint; replacing weights at the
same path therefore invalidates resume before the model is loaded. Prompt source
lines and provider endpoints are bound as well without exposing private paths or
URLs. Streamed SFT/DPO replacements are committed as one rollback-protected set,
and an SFT-only replacement retires a prior manifest-bound DPO in that same
transaction.

### Custom Transforms

Use a dotted-path string (`module.path:function_name`) as the ``transform``
value to import a custom transform at build time:

```yaml
models:
  - {name: clean, kind: table, source: data/raw.jsonl, transform: my_pkg.transforms:clean_row}
  - {name: enriched, kind: table, refs: [clean], transform: my_pkg.transforms:enrich}
```

The target function must accept exactly two positional arguments (`row`, ``config``)
and return a ``dict`` or ``None``. Soup resolves the dotted path lazily (the module
is imported only when the build actually runs) and caches the result so repeated
references to the same path do not re-import.

**Trusted-input posture.** The dotted-path syntax causes Soup to import an
arbitrary Python module and call a function from it. Treat ``transform`` values
as *trusted input*: do not feed untrusted or operator-controlled YAML into ``soup
build`` on shared CI hosts. An attacker who controls the manifest can execute
arbitrary code during the build phase. If you must accept user-supplied manifests,
validate them against a allowlist of permitted transform paths before passing
them to the resolver.


## Production Trace Ecosystem (`soup ingest`)

Closing the data flywheel without leaving your existing observability stack. `soup ingest` parses JSONL exports from every major SaaS dashboard and emits a normalised trace stream that `soup data from-traces` (v0.26) consumes.

```bash
# Six supported sources — adapters for the major SaaS vendors + raw OTel
soup ingest --source langfuse     --logs ./langfuse-export.jsonl --output traces.jsonl
soup ingest --source langsmith    --logs ./langsmith-runs.jsonl
soup ingest --source helicone     --logs ./helicone-requests.jsonl
soup ingest --source openpipe     --logs ./openpipe-export.jsonl
soup ingest --source otel         --logs ./otel-spans.jsonl
soup ingest --source openai-stored --logs ./oai-stored-completions.jsonl
```

With `--logs` the CLI never makes a network call — operators export from their SaaS dashboard or vendor API, then point `soup ingest` at the local file. Auth env vars (`LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` + `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` / `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` / `HELICONE_API_KEY` / `OPENPIPE_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`) are advisory on that path — Soup surfaces which ones authenticate the source. A PII reminder fires on every ingest run (matches v0.26.0 Trace-to-Preference policy).

### Live pull from Langfuse (`--pull`, #204)

Langfuse is the one source Soup can fetch directly, so there is no export step:

```bash
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...   # Project Settings -> API Keys
export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
export LANGFUSE_HOST=https://us.cloud.langfuse.com   # optional: default is https://cloud.langfuse.com
soup ingest --source langfuse --pull --since 7d --output traces.jsonl
```

- **What one row is.** One output row per `GENERATION` observation in the window — the unit that carries a model, the exact input it was given and the output it produced — read from Langfuse's Observations API v2 (`/api/public/traces` is removed from Langfuse Cloud on 2026-11-16) and checked again on each observation, so a server that ignores the `type` filter cannot turn spans or tool calls into rows — they are counted as skipped in the summary. A row's `trace_id` is the observation id. The API returns plain-text input and output as-is but structured values (chat message lists, objects) as JSON inside a string; those are decoded, and a chat message list becomes a `prompt` of every message's content joined by newlines (system prompt included), the same flattening `parse_langfuse` applies to a `{"messages": [...]}` export. An agent trace therefore yields one row per LLM call it made; its spans and tool calls yield none. Generations with no input or no output are skipped and counted in the summary line, so a pull that matched nothing usable says so instead of writing an empty file silently.
- **Credentials.** Read from the environment only, never from a flag, so they never reach the audit log's argv. `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` is honoured before `LANGFUSE_HOST`, the same precedence as the Langfuse SDK. The key pair is not written to the output, the console, debug logs or error messages.
- **Host checks.** HTTPS only. The host goes through the same SSRF validator as `--slack-url`; a private, link-local or loopback address (self-hosted Langfuse) additionally needs `--allow-private-host`. Redirects are refused rather than followed with credentials attached.
- **Bounds.** `--since` accepts `30m` / `24h` / `7d` up to `365d` (default `7d`). Each request is bounded by a 30 s wall-clock deadline covering the connect and the whole response — a server that drip-feeds bytes cannot outlast it — and a response is capped at 64 MiB. Pages hold 100 generations; if results are still pending after `--max-pages` pages (default 100, max 10 000), the command stops with exit 1 and writes nothing — the output streams to a staging file, so an earlier file at `--output` is left untouched. HTTP 429 is retried up to 5 times, honouring `Retry-After` with a 60 s ceiling, and a pagination cursor the server repeats stops the pull instead of spending the rest of the page budget.
- **Without `--pull`** nothing changes: the pull code is not imported and no connection is opened.

The other sources have no live pull yet — export them and pass `--logs`.


## Prompt Mining (`soup prune-prompt`)

Production LLM apps often pin a multi-paragraph system prompt to every request. Fine-tuning with that prefix wastes tokens (the model learns to copy what's already in context). `soup prune-prompt` finds the longest character prefix shared by ≥ 95% of rows and strips it, so the FT model internalises the behaviour instead.

```bash
soup prune-prompt --input traces.jsonl --output pruned.jsonl --min-frequency 0.95
```

Binary-search over up-to-32 candidate templates finds the longest qualifying prefix (a longer threshold-meeting prefix may exist beyond the universal one — Soup does not early-exit on the 100% match). Two-pass file read with a 100 000-row DoS cap.

**Tokenizer-aware mode (v0.71.5).** Pass `--tokenizer <id-or-path>` (a HuggingFace repo id, a local path, or anything `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` accepts) to detect the shared prefix in *token* space and decode only the remaining ids:

```bash
soup prune-prompt --input traces.jsonl --output pruned.jsonl --tokenizer Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B
```

Char-level stripping can cut a BPE multi-byte sequence in half when the shared prefix ends mid-token; token-aware pruning finds the longest shared *token-id* prefix and decodes the remainder, so the boundary always lands on a real token. Per-row encoding is capped at 50 000 tokens. Omit `--tokenizer` to keep the original character-level behaviour.


## Active-Learning Sampler (`soup data active-sample`)

Surface the most uncertain prod traces for human review. Two modes via the input data shape:

- **Single RM:** `rm_score: 0.5` → uncertainty 1.0 (peak); `rm_score: 0.0` or `1.0` → uncertainty 0.0.
- **Dual RM:** `rm_scores: [s1, s2]` → uncertainty = `|s1 - s2|` (pairwise disagreement).

```bash
soup data active-sample --input traces.jsonl --output for-review.jsonl --budget 100
```

The output JSONL is a drop-in prompt set for `soup eval human` (v0.19). Budget is bounded `[1, 100 000]`.

**Webhooks (v0.71.5).** `soup ingest`, `soup prune-prompt`, `soup ab`, and `soup data active-sample` all accept `--slack-url` / `--discord-url` and POST a one-line summary on completion through the same SSRF-hardened validator as `soup drift-alarm` (scheme allowlist, loopback-only HTTP, RFC1918 / link-local / reserved / multicast rejected; the post never raises, so a flaky webhook can't fail the command). `soup ab` only fires when the sequential test actually decides (`reject_h0` / `accept_h0`), not while it's still `continue`-ing.


## Synthetic Data Generation

Generate training data using LLMs:

```bash
# Generate using OpenAI API
soup data generate --prompt "Create math word problems" --count 100 --format alpaca

# Use a different model
soup data generate --prompt "Medical Q&A pairs" --model gpt-4o --count 500

# Deduplicate against existing data
soup data generate --prompt "..." --count 200 --dedup-with existing.jsonl

# Use seed examples to guide style
soup data generate --prompt "..." --seed examples.jsonl --count 100

# Use a local OpenAI-compatible server (soup serve, Ollama, etc.)
soup data generate --prompt "..." --provider server --api-base http://localhost:11434/v1
```

### Multi-Provider Support

```bash
# Generate via local Ollama instance
soup data generate --prompt "..." --provider ollama --model llama3.1
soup data generate --prompt "..." --ollama-model llama3.1  # shorthand

# Generate via Anthropic Claude API (set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var)
soup data generate --prompt "..." --provider anthropic --model claude-3-haiku-20240307

# Generate via local vLLM server
soup data generate --prompt "..." --provider vllm --model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
```

### Domain Templates

```bash
# Code instruction pairs (Python, JS, Go, Rust, Java)
soup data generate --prompt "..." --template code --language Python --task-type function

# Multi-turn conversations
soup data generate --prompt "..." --template conversation --turns 6 --topic "science"

# QA from context document
soup data generate --prompt "..." --template qa --context document.txt

# Preference data (DPO/KTO/ORPO)
soup data generate --prompt "..." --template preference --pref-task dpo

# Chain-of-thought reasoning (GRPO)
soup data generate --prompt "..." --template reasoning --domain math
```

### Quality Pipeline

```bash
# Auto-validate after generation (remove malformed entries)
soup data generate --prompt "..." --validate

# Auto-filter by quality (coherence scoring)
soup data generate --prompt "..." --filter

# Auto-dedup (MinHash, requires: pip install "soup-cli[data]")
soup data generate --prompt "..." --dedup

# Full quality pipeline: validate + filter + dedup
soup data generate --prompt "..." --quality-pipeline
```


## Data Augmentation

Augment an existing dataset using an LLM — rephrase for diversity, translate for multilingual coverage, or apply a style transform.

```bash
# Rephrase each example N times for more diversity
soup data augment ./data/train.jsonl --strategy rephrase --count 3 \
  --output ./data/train_augmented.jsonl

# Translate into multiple languages
soup data augment ./data/train.jsonl --strategy translate --lang es,fr,de \
  --output ./data/train_multilingual.jsonl

# Style transfer (formal / casual / technical / etc.)
soup data augment ./data/train.jsonl --strategy style --styles formal,casual \
  --output ./data/train_styled.jsonl

# Local provider (Ollama / vLLM) — loopback-only, pick the model + base URL
soup data augment ./data/train.jsonl --strategy rephrase --count 2 \
  --provider ollama --model qwen2.5:0.5b --output ./data/train_local.jsonl
```

Works with any provider supported by `soup data generate` (OpenAI, Ollama, vLLM, local server). `--model` and `--base-url` select a specific local model/endpoint; the Ollama/vLLM paths are loopback-only (SSRF-hardened). `--count` is capped at 10; `--lang` and `--styles` each capped at 10 entries × 32 chars.


## Trace-to-Preference

Harvest DPO / KTO-ready preference pairs from your production inference logs — no manual labeling.

```bash
# LangChain logs + thumbs-up signal
soup data from-traces --logs ./logs/langchain.jsonl \
  --format langchain --signal thumbs_up --output prefs.jsonl

# OpenAI API logs + regeneration signal (second response wins)
soup data from-traces --logs ./logs/openai.jsonl \

## Config Migration

Switch from other tools with one command:

```bash
# Import from LLaMA-Factory
soup migrate --from llamafactory llama3_lora_sft.yaml

# Import from Axolotl
soup migrate --from axolotl axolotl_config.yml

# Import from Unsloth notebook
soup migrate --from unsloth finetune.ipynb

# Preview without writing
soup migrate --from llamafactory config.yaml --dry-run
```

Automatically maps model, LoRA, training params, quantization, and task type. Warns about unsupported features.


## Data Formats

Soup supports these formats (auto-detected). Files can be JSONL, JSON, CSV, Parquet, or TXT.

**Alpaca:**
```json
{"instruction": "Explain gravity", "input": "", "output": "Gravity is..."}
```

**ShareGPT:**
```json
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Hi"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Hello!"}]}
```

**ChatML:**
```json
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!"}]}
```

**DPO / ORPO / SimPO / IPO (preference pairs):**
```json
{"prompt": "Explain gravity", "chosen": "Gravity is a force...", "rejected": "I don't know"}
```

**KTO (unpaired preferences):**
```json
{"prompt": "Explain gravity", "completion": "Gravity is a force...", "label": true}
```

**LLaVA (vision):**
```json
{"image": "photo.jpg", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "<image>\nDescribe this."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "A cat."}]}
```

**ShareGPT4V (vision):**
```json
{"image": "chart.png", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "<image>\nExplain this chart."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Revenue growth."}]}
```

**Plaintext (pre-training):**
```json
{"text": "Raw text document for continued pre-training..."}
```
Or use `.txt` files directly (one document per line).

**Embedding (sentence embedding pairs/triplets):**
```json
{"anchor": "What is Python?", "positive": "Python is a programming language."}
{"anchor": "What is Python?", "positive": "A programming language.", "negative": "A type of snake."}
```

**Audio (speech + conversation):**
```json
{"audio": "recording.wav", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Transcribe."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello world."}]}
```

**ASR (Whisper transcription — `data.format: asr`, v0.71.32):**
```json
{"audio": "clip.wav", "text": "hello world"}
```
Audio paths resolve under `data.audio_dir` (containment-checked). Used by
`task: asr` and `soup infer --task asr`. See [Training → ASR](training.md).

**PRM (process reward, stepwise-supervised):**
```json
{"prompt": "Solve 2+2", "completions": ["First, add", "Result is 4"], "labels": [true, true]}
```

```json
{"input_ids": [1, 2, 3, ...], "labels": [-100, 2, 3, ...], "attention_mask": [1, 1, 1, ...]}
```
Use with `data.format: pre_tokenized` and `data.tokenized_path: ./.soup-tokenized/<key>` after running `soup data preprocess`.

**Input/Output (template-free, segment-level loss control):**
```json
{"segments": [{"text": "Q: hi", "label": false}, {"text": "A: hello", "label": true}]}
```

**Video:**
```json
{"video": "clip.mp4", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Describe this clip."}]}
```

**Multimodal (typed content parts — text / image / audio / video in one message):**
```json
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What's in this?"}, {"type": "image", "url": "x.png"}]}]}
```


## Data Pipeline Pro

Soup speaks the same dataset surface as Axolotl + LlamaFactory + Unsloth — remote URIs, streaming, sharding, multi-dataset interleaving, vocab expansion, and document ingestion all live in one schema.

**Remote datasets** are loaded through the matching fsspec backend:

```yaml
data:
  train: s3://my-bucket/datasets/train.jsonl   # also gs:// gcs:// az:// abfs:// abfss:// oci://
  streaming: true
  buffer_size: 8192
  shards: 4
```

**HuggingFace Hub names** (a single `data.train` like `org/dataset`): `data.streaming: true`
is forwarded to `datasets.load_dataset(..., streaming=True)` and `buffer_size` shuffles
that stream, then Soup materialises up to 1M rows — the same shape as remote (#689).
An all-hub *list* with `streaming: true` is still refused (#459). `buffer_size` shuffles the train split only; a capped validation split takes the first N rows unshuffled.

**Multi-dataset interleave** (v0.42.0 schema, wired into training-time loading in #443;
extended to streaming and HF-hub dataset names in #459):

```yaml
data:
  train:
    - dolma.jsonl
    - wikipedia.jsonl
  interleave: { strategy: probs, probs: [0.7, 0.3] }   # also: concat / under / over
  # eval_on_each_dataset: true                         # staged; refused as of v0.77 — #808
```

`data.train` as a list requires `data.interleave` (and vice versa). `training.packing` /
`training.multipack` must be off. With the `probs` strategy, `len(data.train)` must equal
`len(probs)`.

Every list entry is classified once — **local** file path, **remote** URI, or **HF-hub**
dataset name (no *recognised* file suffix — `.jsonl` / `.json` / `.csv` / `.parquet` /
`.txt` only count as local; a hub name with a version number like `teknium/OpenHermes-2.5`
still classifies as hub) — and the classes may not mix within one list. Any entry
containing `"://"` classifies as remote regardless of scheme — a scheme outside the
allowlist (e.g. `https://`, `http://`, `ftp://`) is refused by name at load time rather
than silently falling through to local/hub classification:

- **All entries local files and/or remote URIs:** with `data.streaming: false` (default),
  entries must be local files only (the original #443 path, eager-loaded and combined
  in-process). With `data.streaming: true`, entries may also be remote URIs, and combining
  delegates to HF `datasets.interleave_datasets` / `concatenate_datasets` instead — a
  remote URI entry always requires `data.streaming: true` (there is no non-streaming
  multi-remote-file loader). Each remote entry is canonicalised through the same
  SSRF-hardened `validate_remote_uri` allowlist used everywhere else in Soup (bucket
  regex, no userinfo / query / fragment) before it reaches the streaming loader. The
  streaming path supports the same file types as local loading — `.jsonl` / `.json` /
  `.csv` / `.parquet` / `.txt` — chosen per entry by suffix, so flipping only
  `data.streaming: true` keeps reading the same file format instead of misparsing it as
  JSON; an unrecognised suffix refuses by name rather than reaching the HF loader.
- **All entries HF-hub dataset names** (e.g. `teknium/OpenHermes-2.5`): each name's own
  `train` split is loaded and combined the same way as the local-file path. Always eager —
  `data.streaming: true` is not yet supported for an all-hub-name list (streaming several
  differently-shaped hub datasets through their own split negotiation is unimplemented and
  refuses at parse time, by name). A hub entry's own `validation` split is used for the
  combined val set **only when every entry provides one** (combined the same way); if only
  some entries provide one it is ignored (warned) and `data.val_split` is derived instead:
  per source before `over`/`probs` pad it, same as the local-file path below, or from the
  combined train rows for `concat`/`under`. A partial hub split is not a decided mixture.
- **A mix of hub names with local/remote entries in the same list** always refuses — there
  is no decided answer for how a hub split and a local file's row count should reconcile.

The strategy names mean the same thing on the streaming path as on the local path, though
not byte-identically (a streaming source's size generally can't be known ahead of time):

| strategy | local (eager)                                   | streaming (delegated)                                                        |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `concat` | every source's rows, in order                     | `concatenate_datasets(streams)`                                              |
| `under`  | truncate every source to the smallest source's size | `interleave_datasets(streams, stopping_strategy="first_exhausted")`       |
| `over`   | upsample every source to the largest source's size (cycled) | `interleave_datasets(streams, stopping_strategy="all_exhausted")` |
| `probs`  | exact apportionment to the requested ratio        | `interleave_datasets(streams, probabilities=probs, stopping_strategy="first_exhausted")` — converges to the same ratio, sampled rather than exact |

On the local (eager) and all-hub-name paths, `data.val_split` is applied per source before
`over`/`probs` pad it with copies of its own rows, so a padded row can never land on both
sides of the split; `concat`/`under` never duplicate rows and still split the combined
result as before.

The streaming path reaches the same guarantee by a different route (#702). A stream is not
countable ahead of time, so there is nothing to take a fraction of before interleaving
starts; instead, once `over` has been materialised, the split is sized over the *distinct*
rows and val is taken from the end of the stream, preferring rows whose content occurs only
once, so train keeps every row and all of its oversampling. Only if there are too few such
rows is repeated content moved to val, and then its other copies are withheld from train
and the number withheld is printed as a warning. A split that would leave train empty
raises instead. Because val comes from distinct rows in stream order rather than from each
source in turn, **it is not balanced across sources**: with 100 rows against 10 under
`val_split: 0.1`, every val row comes from the larger source, since the smaller one's rows
are all recycled. The eager path's per-source carve-out is mixture-representative; this one
is not.

`concat`/`under`/`probs` do not *add* duplicates on the streaming path (only `over` uses
`stopping_strategy="all_exhausted"`), so they keep the ordinary positional split. That is a
statement about interleaving, not about your data: rows that are already duplicated in a
source can still land on both sides of the split under any strategy, on either path.

Splitting before padding also means the requested `val_split` fraction is no longer exact
under `over`/`probs`: it is taken from each source's own (smaller, unpadded) row count, so
the held-out share of the final, padded total comes out lower than requested. For example,
two sources of 1000 and 100 rows with `over` and `val_split: 0.1` yield 110 val rows out of
1910 total (5.8%), not the 200/2000 (10%) a single-source split would give. `concat`/`under`
are unaffected (they never pad). This is the trade-off for closing the duplicate-row leak,
not a separate bug: holding out an exact 10% of the padded total would mean some val rows
are copies of val rows already counted, or of train rows.

Train and val also end up with different source mixtures once `over`/`probs` pads: val is
carved from each source's original, unpadded rows, while train sees the padded, rebalanced
mix. Anyone who oversampled specifically to correct a source imbalance gets a validation set
that still reflects the original, un-rebalanced skew, not the mixture train now trains on.

**Vocab expansion + advanced masking:**

```yaml
data:
  add_new_tokens: ["<reasoning>", "</reasoning>"]
  new_special_tokens: ["<|tool_call|>"]
  mask_history: true              # train only on the LAST assistant turn
  # Staged fields below warn in v0.76 and are refused as of v0.77 (#808):
  # resize_vocab: true
  # split_thinking: true            # Qwen3-style <think> reasoning-block masking
  # image_min_pixels: 256
  # image_max_pixels: 4096
  # image_resize_algorithm: bicubic
  # video_fps: 24
  # video_maxlen: 32
  # video_dir: ./videos
```

`mask_history: true` keeps only the **last** assistant turn in the loss: every
earlier assistant turn is masked alongside the user and system turns the
assistant-only path already excludes. It never adds tokens to the loss.

It only means something for a **multi-turn chat shape** — `chatml`, `sharegpt`
and the other message-list formats — where turns exist to mask. A single-turn
conversation trains identically with it on or off, and a flat format such as
`alpaca` or `plaintext` has no turns at all.

It requires `train_on_responses_only: true`, which is the path that marks
assistant spans; with `false` every token trains, including the history this
field asks to exclude, so the combination is refused at config load. That also
rules out `train_on_messages_with_train_field`, which is itself exclusive with
`train_on_responses_only`: the per-message `train` field and `mask_history` can
never both decide a run.

On text SFT it is honoured by the transformers and unsloth backends, which run
the same `SFTTrainerWrapper.setup()` row builder, and `task: distill` honours it
too, since distill builds every row that way. On `task: sft` with
`modality: vision` or `audio` it is accepted but not applied: those rows are
built by the vision and audio preparers, which never read it (#1156).

**`backend: mlx` ignores it:** MLX SFT builds its own mask and supervises every
assistant turn, so the same config trains the last turn on transformers and every
turn on MLX. `soup train` says so on its "MLX backend ignores:" line, and
`soup doctor --config` reports it.

**Multimodal vision and audio ignore it:** For `modality: vision` and `modality: audio`,
every text token is supervised. Soup's vision collator masks only padding and image
tokens, and the audio path only padding. Assistant-only masking would have to locate the
assistant spans after the processor expands the image or audio tokens, which neither path
does yet. Soup declares this gap rather
than attempting unverified label restructuring, so both `mask_history` and `train_on_responses_only`
are unread on vision and audio modalities, every text token trains, and `soup doctor --config`
reports them as ignored.


**AOT preprocessing:**

```bash
# Tokenize once, reuse the cache across runs.
soup data preprocess soup.yaml --output ./.soup-tokenized

# Then in soup.yaml:
#   data:
#     format: pre_tokenized
#     tokenized_path: ./.soup-tokenized/<16-char-cache-key>
```

**Document ingestion (PDF / DOCX / MD / TXT → JSONL):**

```bash
soup data ingest report.pdf --output report.jsonl
soup data ingest README.md
soup data ingest notes.docx
```

**Custom prompt strategies (schema only — runtime invocation in v0.42.1):**

```yaml
data:
  prompt_strategy: my_pkg.transforms:rephrase
```


## Data Tools

```bash
# Inspect a dataset
soup data inspect ./data/train.jsonl

# Validate format (auto-detects if --format not specified)
soup data validate ./data/train.jsonl
soup data validate ./data/train.jsonl --format alpaca

# Require at least 90% of rows to be usable
soup data validate ./data/train.jsonl --min-valid-fraction 0.9

# Convert between formats
soup data convert ./data/train.jsonl --to sharegpt --output converted.jsonl

# Merge multiple datasets
soup data merge data1.jsonl data2.jsonl --output merged.jsonl --shuffle

# Remove near-duplicates (requires: pip install "soup-cli[data]")
soup data dedup ./data/train.jsonl --threshold 0.8

# Extended statistics (length distribution, token counts, languages)
soup data stats ./data/train.jsonl

# Filter by quality (perplexity + coherence scoring)
soup data filter ./data/train.jsonl --coherence 0.3
soup data filter ./data/train.jsonl --perplexity 500 --coherence 0.3
soup data filter ./data/train.jsonl --score-only  # add scores without filtering

# Clean dataset (control chars, zero-width spaces, empty turns; opt-in heuristics)
soup data clean ./data/train.jsonl
soup data clean ./data/train.jsonl -o ./data/clean.jsonl --dry-run
```

`soup data validate` exits with code `0` when at least one row is usable and the
optional minimum valid fraction is met. It exits with code `3` for input errors,
such as a missing file or an undetectable format, and code `2` when a non-empty
dataset has no usable rows or falls below `--min-valid-fraction`. A partially valid
dataset still exits with code `0` when no minimum is specified.

Training loads a dataset through the same converters, and a row they reject is
dropped rather than stopping the run, so one bad line does not abort a load. The
drop is reported: `soup train`, and every other command that loads a dataset,
prints `Warning: N of M rows dropped` with the first row's index and the
converter's reason. For a local file it also prints the `soup data validate`
command that lists them all. The
count agrees with `soup data validate` for the same file. Before #1181 the rows
were dropped without a word.


## Demo Datasets (`soup data demo`)

Tiny JSONL fixtures bundled with Soup so you can warm up `soup train` without
hunting for data:

```bash
# List available bundles
soup data demo

# Copy one into the current directory
soup data demo alpaca_demo --output ./alpaca.jsonl
```

Bundles: `alpaca_demo`, `sharegpt_demo`, `dpo_demo`, `grpo_demo`. Output path
must stay under cwd; existing files are not overwritten.


## Trace-to-Preference: LLM-Judge Filter

`soup data from-traces --judge` filters harvested preference pairs through an LLM judge:

```bash
soup data from-traces \
  --logs ./prod-traces.jsonl --format langchain --signal thumbs_up \
  --output ./prefs.jsonl \
  --judge --judge-provider ollama --judge-model llama3 \
  --min-confidence 0.7
```

The judge scores `chosen` and `rejected` independently against its rubric (default helpfulness/accuracy/safety on a 1-5 scale). Pairs whose normalised `(chosen - rejected)` confidence falls below `--min-confidence` are dropped. Per-pair backend exceptions are counted (not crashed) and reported. Provider allowlist `{openai, server, ollama}` validated at the CLI boundary; SSRF protection on `--judge-api-base` carries over from `soup eval judge`.


## Synthetic Data Forge

Multi-stage synthetic data pipeline with full provenance — every synthetic row links back to the source document, the judge call, and the filter score:

```bash
# Pipeline: chunk docs → judge → active-prune → JSONL + provenance manifest
soup data forge \
    --docs ./my_docs/ \
    --task sft \
    --target-rows 1000 \
    --uncertainty-threshold 0.4 \
    --output forge_dataset.jsonl \
    --provenance forge_provenance.json
```

Three tasks supported: `sft` (Q&A pairs), `preference` (chosen/rejected), `tool` (tool-call hypotheses). Active learning prunes rows whose judge reply is too close to the source chunk (low Jaccard distance), keeping only uncertain / informative samples. The provenance manifest is a separate JSON file mapping every row id to `{source_doc, judge_id, chunk_id, filter_score}` so you have a complete audit trail for compliance.

Document discovery is one level deep over `.txt` / `.md` / `.json` / `.jsonl`; dotfiles + symlinked directories are skipped. All paths are cwd-contained, all writes are atomic via staged-tempfile + `os.replace`, and write targets are rejected if they're symlinks. **Judge providers are live**: `--judge-provider ollama` (localhost-only), `--judge-provider anthropic` (env-only API key), `--judge-provider vllm` (scheme-validated). Per-call judge exceptions logged at DEBUG.

**Alternative teacher hubs (v0.71.5).** `--hub modelscope|modelers` pre-fetches the `--teacher` from that hub when the teacher is a routable repo id (`owner/name`); `--hub hf` (default) is a no-op and leaves the teacher as a provenance label. If `--hub` is non-HF but `--teacher` is not a repo id (e.g. the default `local-judge`), Soup prints a loud yellow warning rather than silently dropping the flag.


## Data Quality Scorecard

Composite, lightweight data-quality triage — no GPU, no 200 MB Presidio model:

```bash
# Single-shot composite scorecard
soup data score --input training.jsonl

# Standalone subcommands — JSONL-in, enriched JSONL-out
soup data pii          --input training.jsonl --output pii_flagged.jsonl
soup data toxicity     --input training.jsonl --output tox_flagged.jsonl --threshold 0.1
soup data langdetect   --input training.jsonl --output tagged.jsonl
soup data educational  --input training.jsonl --output scored.jsonl
soup data decontaminate --input training.jsonl --benchmarks mmlu,gsm8k,humaneval --output clean.jsonl
```

The scorecard reports PII matches, abuse-keyword matches, language distribution, mean heuristic educational value, and decontamination removals. PII detection uses a narrow ReDoS-hardened regex set (email / phone / SSN / credit-card) with a 50 KB pre-cap on every input. Language detection is a stopword heuristic across six languages. `soup data toxicity` is retained as a compatible command name, but its output is explicitly an abuse-keyword heuristic, not a toxicity classifier. Ambiguous technical and medical terms such as process `kill`, thread `die`, and heart `attack` are not treated as standalone safety signals. This trades one known failure mode for explicit limitations: in maintainer review, 9 of 10 held-out abusive examples scored zero and 10 of 12 benign technical or editorial examples were flagged at the default threshold. Use it only for keyword triage, never as a safety decision. The default Magpie quality filter therefore applies only non-empty and educational heuristics; provide an explicit model-backed policy outside Soup when safety classification is required. The `[data-pro]` extra currently adds `langdetect` and Presidio only; it does not install Llama Guard or FineWeb-Edu. Decontamination uses n-gram containment against benchmark corpora: use `--benchmarks mmlu,gsm8k` for built-in allowlist, or `--benchmark-file custom_benchmark.jsonl` for your own corpus.


## Remote Datasets (S3 / GCS / Azure / OCI)

Point `data.train` at any object in the v0.42.0 fsspec allowlist and `soup train` will stream it through `fsspec.open` after running the URI through the same SSRF-hardened validator used everywhere else in Soup (bucket regex, no userinfo / query / fragment):

```yaml
data:
  train: s3://my-bucket/datasets/train.jsonl
  format: alpaca
  streaming: true       # opt-in HF datasets streaming with shuffle
  buffer_size: 10000    # shuffle buffer (requires streaming=true)
```

Recognised schemes: `s3://`, `gs://`, `gcs://`, `az://`, `abfs://`, `abfss://`, `oci://`. The matching backend SDK (`s3fs` / `gcsfs` / `adlfs` / `ocifs`) is lazy-imported — install only what you need or grab the convenience extra:

```bash
pip install soup-cli[remote]   # fsspec + s3fs + gcsfs + adlfs
```

Materialised rows are capped at 1M to defend against pathological remote objects; use a local split for larger jobs.


## Data Recipe DAG

```bash
soup data recipe my_recipe.yaml
```

```yaml
nodes:
  - name: seed1
    kind: seed
    config: {path: prompts.jsonl}
  - name: llm1
    kind: llm_text
    config: {prompt: "Answer the request: {text}"}
  - name: judge1
    kind: judge
  - name: samp1
    kind: sampler
edges:
  - [seed1, llm1]
  - [llm1, judge1]
  - [judge1, samp1]
```

Closed node-kind allowlist (`seed` / `llm_text` / `code` / `judge` / `validator` / `sampler`); Kahn's topological sort via `collections.deque` (deterministic, O(N+E)); cycle / self-loop / duplicate-edge / dangling-edge / unknown-kind rejection. `_MAX_NODES=256`, `_MAX_EDGES=1024`, `_MAX_FILE_BYTES=1MiB`. The recipe file must stay under cwd and **must not be a symlink** (`os.lstat + S_ISLNK` TOCTOU defence).


## Data Mixing Optimizer (BETA)

Search for the dataset mixture weights that minimise eval loss on a short proxy run.

```bash
soup data mix --optimize --budget 1h \
    --datasets dolma.jsonl,wikipedia.jsonl,arxiv.jsonl \
    --num-probes 8 --output mix_recipe.yaml
```

Writes a YAML recipe you can splice into your `soup.yaml`: `data.train` renders as the full ranked dataset list (index-aligned with `data.interleave.probs`), and `data.interleave` carries the searched mixture weights — as of #443, `data.interleave` is fully wired into training-time dataset loading, so `soup train` consumes the real N-dataset mixture this search found rather than collapsing to one path. `--budget` accepts `60s` / `5m` / `1h` / `24h`. Per-candidate proxy failures are isolated (DEBUG-logged, sentinel high loss recorded) so a single OOM combo does not abort the whole search; `partial=True` is surfaced in the report when the budget cap trips mid-loop.

Re-apply a previously written recipe:

```bash
soup data mix --apply mix_recipe.yaml
```

Pass `--live --base-yaml soup.yaml` to score each candidate with a short `soup train` proxy run. Without `--live`, Soup uses a synthetic offline proxy (quadratic penalty around the uniform simplex) so the budget tracker, optimiser surface, and recipe writer can be exercised without GPUs. `scikit-optimize` is opt-in via `OptimizerProtocol`; the default fallback is a deterministic Dirichlet sampler.


## AOT Tokenization with `soup data preprocess`

Pre-tokenize your dataset once and cache Arrow shards keyed by
`(dataset, tokenizer, max_length, format, chat_template, loss-mask mode, task)`:

```bash
soup data preprocess soup.yaml --output ./tokenized_cache
```

SFT and Pretrain trainers short-circuit at schema validation when
`format: pre_tokenized` + `tokenized_path: ./tokenized_cache` is set, eliminating
the per-epoch tokenization tax. Cache keys ensure resume safety; partial runs pick
up from the last completed shard.

Rows are rendered with `data.chat_template` when it is set, the same as live
training. The `pre_tokenized` training config must name the same template, since
training saves the tokenizer with it; a different one is refused with
`cache hash mismatch`. A cache written before the template joined the key is
refused the same way: re-run `soup data preprocess` to rebuild it.

A row the command cannot tokenize stops it, and nothing is written. For pretrain
that is a text row the tokenizer rejects (a lone surrogate, for example), which
live pretraining refuses too; an empty `text` row is dropped by the loader on both
paths. That covers a conversation the template rejects (for example
`Conversation roles must alternate` on a Llama-2- or Gemma-style template), an
empty `messages` list, a row the template renders as empty text, and a tokenizer
error. The message numbers the row from 1, as live training does, counting the
rows that survived loading, and quotes the start of its first message (or of a
pretrain row's text), which is what finds it when an earlier row was dropped or
the files were interleaved. Live training stops on a rejected conversation, an
empty one and an empty render too, so a cache that skipped them would train on
fewer rows than the same `soup.yaml` run live. Before #1180 they were dropped
without a word, and the command exited 0. Fix or remove the row and re-run. A
tokenizer with no chat template is reported once, before any row, and points at
`data.chat_template`. The rows are checked when the command builds a cache: if one
with the same key already exists it stops at `Target already exists` (exit 0)
without reading them, so rebuild a cache written before this change with `--yes`.

Cached rows carry a `labels` column masked exactly as the equivalent live run
would mask it (`data.train_on_responses_only` /
`data.train_on_messages_with_train_field`, plus `data.mask_history` and
`training.train_on_eot`). That mask mode is part of the cache key too, so a cache
built under one masking setting is refused — with the same
`cache hash mismatch` error — when loaded under a different one. Caches written
before this fix (tokenizer schema `v5` and earlier) have no `labels` and are
rejected; re-run `soup data preprocess`. With `task: sft`, a `pre_tokenized`
dataset you built yourself must carry its own `labels` column (`-100` on every
token not to train on); a train or validation split without one is refused
rather than trained on every token. `task: pretrain` has no such check: a
dataset without `labels` trains on every token, because TRL's collator copies
`input_ids` into `labels`. That is the pretraining objective, and a
`soup data preprocess` cache built for `task: pretrain` records the same labels.

The full key, as `PREPROCESS_KEY_FIELDS` in `soup_cli/utils/data_pipeline.py`
declares it:

| Key input | Config fields |
|---|---|
| dataset | `data.train`, `data.interleave`, `data.val_split`, `data.replay`, `data.replay_ratio`, `data.replay_seed`, `data.streaming`, `data.buffer_size`, `data.image_dir`, `data.audio_dir` |
| tokenizer | `base` |
| max_length | `data.max_length` |
| format | `data.format` (the source format preprocess read, recorded in `metadata.json`) |
| chat_template | `data.chat_template`, resolved to the Jinja it renders |
| loss-mask mode | `data.train_on_responses_only`, `data.train_on_messages_with_train_field`, `data.mask_history`, `training.train_on_eot` |
| task | `task` |

The dataset input covers every setting that decides which rows are cached: only
the train split is cached, replay rows are mixed into it first, and the streaming
loaders choose rows and their order. Every other `data` field is listed in
`NOT_PREPROCESS_KEY_FIELDS` with the reason it cannot change a cached row, and a
new field must be added to one of the two tables. Caches written before this
(tokenizer schema `v6` and earlier) are refused; re-run `soup data preprocess`.


## Data Recipe DAG Runner (`soup data recipe --execute`)

Execute a Data Recipe DAG end-to-end:

```bash
soup data recipe path/to/recipe.yaml --execute --output ./out \
    --provider ollama --model llama3.1
```

`llm_text` and `judge` nodes support `ollama`, `anthropic`, and `vllm`; use
`--base-url` to override the loopback endpoint for Ollama or vLLM. Running either
node kind without `--provider` is refused so placeholder data cannot be mistaken
for live generations. For deterministic tests only, `--offline` explicitly enables
`llm_text(offline): ...` placeholders and makes judge nodes accept every row; the
command prints a warning whenever this mode is active.

Live provider-call failures are counted: if every attempted call for an `llm_text`
or `judge` node fails, the command names the endpoint and exits 1. Partial failures
keep usable rows and report their count in the completion summary, while a provider
that legitimately returns an empty completion still counts as a successful call.

Six node kinds now run live: **seed** (JSONL load), **llm_text** (LLM generation via
Ollama, Anthropic, or vLLM), **code** (execution via RLVR sandbox), **judge** (binary scoring),
**validator** (regex or JSON schema), **sampler** (deterministic selection). Checkpoint
written per node; resume rehydrates from per-node sidecars. Failed rows logged with
redacted reasons (paths stripped, capped at 256 chars).
Regex validator nodes reject structurally unsafe patterns before matching rows;
the error identifies the node's `config.regex` field. Simple alternations remain
valid.


## Fine-tune Doctor (`soup data doctor`)

Chat-template compatibility report — catches the top *silent* fine-tuning failures
before a single training step:

```bash
soup data doctor ./data/train.jsonl --model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct

# Render N sample rows with per-token trained/masked colouring, through the REAL
# collator path (answer-only / per-message-train-field / RAFT span-mask)
soup data doctor ./data/train.jsonl --model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --show-mask 5
```

Eight checks, same OK/MINOR/MAJOR taxonomy as `soup diagnose` (exit 0 on OK/MINOR,
exit 2 on MAJOR): `chat_template` (tokenizer has one), `template_render` (renders
cleanly on a sample), `generation_markers` (`{% generation %}` support),
`eos_in_labels` — the **#1 "model never stops generating" bug**: every trained
assistant turn must actually contain an EOS/EOT token, checked across the *whole*
trained span, not just the last turn — `bos_duplication` (template + tokenizer both
prepending BOS), `system_role` (Mistral-style templates that reject a leading system
turn), `unknown_roles`, and `truncation_risk` (p95 rendered length vs
`data.max_length`). `--train-on-responses-only` / `--train-on-messages-with-train-field`
select the same masking strategy `soup train` would use, so the report and
`--show-mask` preview can never disagree about what's actually trained.
`--mask-history` (default off, matching `data.mask_history`) narrows the
assistant-only mask to the **last** assistant turn, exactly like the
soup.yaml flag of the same name; it requires `--train-on-responses-only`
and is refused otherwise.


## Preference-Data Linter (`soup data lint`)

Catches the top silent degradations in DPO/ORPO/SimPO/IPO/BCO/KTO preference data:

```bash
soup data lint ./data/prefs.jsonl
soup data lint ./data/prefs.jsonl --model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct  # exact token-length bias, not word count
```

Five checks: `length_bias` — the **#1 silent DPO degradation**: `chosen`
systematically longer than `rejected`, reported as a Cohen's d effect size; MAJOR
needs |d| >= 0.8 and mean lengths at least 10% apart, MINOR |d| >= 0.3 and 5%, so a
consistent one-word gap between near-constant lengths is not flagged —
`label_imbalance` (KTO desirable:undesirable ratio), `near_duplicates`
(MinHash/LSH, reuses the `soup data dedup` kernel; requires
`pip install "soup-cli[data]"`, degrades to an advisory skip otherwise),
`identical_pairs` (`chosen == rejected` — zero preference signal), and
`prompt_leak` (the prompt echoed verbatim inside the completion, a common
synthetic-data pipeline bug). For conversational `chosen` / `rejected` (message
lists), `length_bias` and `prompt_leak` read only the assistant turns, since the
leading user turn is the prompt itself. Same OK/MINOR/MAJOR taxonomy and exit codes as
`soup data doctor`.
